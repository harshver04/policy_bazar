	<p>The birth of a child brings immense joy to parents and the extended family. However, it brings with it a range of duties and responsibilities. It is a time to reflect and plan well so that the journey of parenting is smooth.</p>
						
<p>Parents want to provide only the best to their child. They want their progeny to have the best clothes, eat good food, study in the best school and then go to the best college. The best gift a parent can give their child is a bright and secure future and this is possible if they start financial planning early.</p><br />

						<p> Timely investment planning allows sufficient funds at one’s disposal at key milestones in a child’s life. Even if something happens to the parent, the child will continue to live comfortably. The best child insurance plan offers a comprehensive life insurance cover along with the extra edge of financial support for the child’s future education and career.
</p>
						
						
						<br /><p>There are two types of maturity benefits to choose from in child plans. One can either go for a money back option which offers guaranteed payouts every year after a few years or a lump sum payout at the end of maturity of the policy. Depending on one’s requirements, financial situation, and current and future income, one may choose among the two options. The lump sum payout gives a huge chunk of money which can be utilised towards higher education, marriage or buying the child a house
Accidental Disability rider offers an immediate lump sum payment on occurrence of any disability due to an accident.
