						<p>
	Life is uncertain. The whole idea of taking insurance is to protect oneself and one’s family from uncertainties and eventualities. A life insurance policy safeguards you against unexpected demise and a health policy includes medicinal expenditure in the event of an illness. The diseases not specified in the documents come under exclusion segment. One is likely to believe that life insurance and health insurance cover all the insurance requirements of an individual, however, this is not true. This IRDA approved plan takes care of events, such as demise and disabilities are a must.</p><br/><br/>
						

						
						<p> Accidents are undesirable, unexpected and unplanned incidents which may cause physical injury, impairment, and even demise, excluding ones resulting from any self-inflicted act. Such mishaps happen without prior intimation when one is least expecting such an event. They become stumbling blocks in leading a normal life and often compromise the ability to earn a living. Such policies are meant for such situations and plug this important gap in one’s insurance portfolio, which is not adequately covered by a life and health policy. This policy does authorize the insured to avail an extra layer of protection for his or her loved ones if they already have an insurance plan like an endowment policy.

						<p>
						Other benefits include hospitalisation, hospital bill payment, compensation of ambulance cost etc.
